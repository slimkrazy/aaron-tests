    <p>With <a href="https://nyfw.com/home/"target="_blank">NYFW</a>  on the horizon, I thought it would be great to investigate the interplay between fashion and style and how we can take the best of the runway and make it our own.</p>

  <!--First section relating to fashion in general-->

  <h3 id="firstpara"><u>Jetsetting Trendsetters</u></h3>
    <p>The various fashion weeks around the globe have a major impact on what's in, giving us a glimpse into what we might see on the highstreets of London, Paris, Milan etc. <strong>NYFW</strong> however has that extra spice, since it's being hosted in the cultural hub of the Earth, NYFW's level of influence on cannot be understated.</p>
    <p>To get the most out of it, you'll need to ensure you've got a good idea of the brands that align with you stylistically which we'll get into abit more later. Take a look at the exhibiting brands and be selective since you won't be able to go to every show. The greater insight you have into the brand's identity, their silouhettes, colour schemes etc. the more nectar you'll be able to squeeze out of NYFW.</p>

    <p>As we evolve throughout life so does our style. This process can be passive, forgetting that we even had a shell suit gathering moth balls at the back of our wardrobes as we just stopped wearing it.<br><br> On the other hand, we can actively guide this process, making concious outfit selections that most authentically represent our inner world. I beleive that the more deliberate we are with this process, the more authentic, expressive and stylish we become. For those who are beginning that journey of calculated self expression via style, NYFW might be a great muse.

  <p>You might say, I already have my style and I'm happy with it just the way it is! And to that I would say it's a great thing to have a strong sense of identity via style but it doesn't have to be an immovable object. Just as with our tastes in music, we may have a particular genre we frequent often say soul for example but that doesn't mean we can't dabble in some UK Garage here and there.<br><br>NYFW could be the trip to the record shop you never new you needed, granting your style a new lease of life as you preview the latest silouhettes, colourways and designs produced by the worlds greatest designers.</p>

  <!--Final paragraph pertaining to the coming together of fashion and style-->

  <h3 id="thirdpara"><u>Synthesis</u></h3>
    <p> Don't you just <strong>hate</strong> it when you're in the queue for a coffee and there's two other people in that queue with the same fit as you? This tends to happen when we take the passive approach with our style choices and let the currents of  fashion direct how we appear in the world.<br><br>What I'm advocating for is a synthesis of sorts. We're not aiming to be so dogmatic and rigid with our styling that we become crystallised, nor are we just slaves to whatever the next trend is, clones on the high street. Rather we select and curate from the past, watch what the Guccis, LVs, and Margielas are doing in the present and blend the two in our own ways to create a more pluralistic fashion industry. See you at NYFW 2023.<br><br>
