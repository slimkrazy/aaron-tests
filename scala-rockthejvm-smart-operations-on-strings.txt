                                 SMART OPS ON STRINGS
    


SPECIFYING THE CHARACTER WE WANT TO PRINT WITHIN A STRING:

val str: String = "Hello, I am learning Scala." 

  println(str.charAt(2))
    
    
    SYNTAX BREAKDOWN:
    
    1. We've declared a valu named it "str" of type String.
    2. We've given this val the value of "Hello, I am learning Scala."
    3. We've printed the val but specifically the second character of the string as it starts
       with 0.
    4. The . in "(str.charAt(2)) is what is known as a method call.
    - Look up what a method call is. charAtx returns the character at that index.


SUBSTRINGS:

val strr: String = "Master Engineer"

println(str.substring(3, 7))

Substrings can take 1 or 2 indices. For example in this case, "Master Engineer" 
when executing println(str.substring(3, 7)) will print "ter" because it prints character 3
inclusive up to character 7 EXCLUSIVE.


SPLIT:

val strrr: String = "Depop Back-End Engineer"

Println(strrr.split(" ").toList)

A split operation in String will split a string into multiple pieces depending on the amount of
delimiters in the string. Split returns an array of all the substrings, which in this example:
"Depop Back-End Engineer" are the words separated by spaces.

This is what the output looks like in the console: List(Depop, Back, End, Engineer)


TESTS FOR STRINGS:

val stringg: String = "I am learning Scala for work"

println(stringg.startsWith("Hi"))

This operation will return a boolean expression in the console.
In this case it will return false because the string starts with I.


REPLACEMENT FUNCTIONS:

1. replace

val strang: String = "I'm enjoying Scala"

println(strang.replace("a", "e"))

Does what it says on the tin, replaces the first specified character "a" with 
the last "e"

2. toLowerCase

val strang: String = "I'm enjoying Scala"

println(strang.toLowerCase("a", "A"))

Does what it says on the tin, replaces all upper-case characters with lowercase 

3. length

val strang: String = "I'm enjoying Scala"

println(strang.length)

Gives you the number of characters the string is comprised of.


- These are all Java functions that are available in Scala because Scala runs on the jvm 
Java Virtual Machine


SCALA SPECIFIC STRING FUNCTIONS:

1. Changing a number to an Int

val aNumberString = "45"

val aNumber = aNumberString.toInt

This does what it says on the tin, changing any type of number to an int.


2. Concatenation, prepending and appending strings.

val aNumberString = "45"

println('a' +: aNumberString)

This will "prepend" the character "a" to the number 45, outputting to the console
"a45"

println( aNumberString :+ 'a'  )
This is the symmetrical operation appending which should result in 45a

The following is a function with both prepending and appending characters
println( 'a' +: aNumberString :+ 'a'  )
resulting in "a45a"


3. Reverse

val strang: String = "Rock the jvm Scala"
println(strang.reverse) 

output: alacS mvj eht kcoR


4. List functions

val strang: String = "Rock the jvm Scala"
println(strang.take(2)) 
This will take the first two characters out of a string.

output: Ro 


SCALA SPECIFIC: STRING INTERPOLATORS

Interpolator: An Interpolatoris a function or algorithm used to calculate 
intermediate values between two keyframes or key points.

S - Interpolators:

Normal greeting function: def aGreetingFunction(name: String, age: Int): String =
"Hi my name is "+ name +" and I'm "+ age +" years old"

println(aGreetingFunction("Aaron", 28))

Variation of the implementation for greeting function (My name is Aaron and I'm 28 years old)

val name = "Aaron"
val age = 28
val greeting = s"Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old."

  println(greeting)

The "s" interpolator injects the  declared values into the greeting string.
An easier more efficent way of writing the function than the former.
