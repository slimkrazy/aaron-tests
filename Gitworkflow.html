    <h1> GIT BASICS</h1>
      <p>
        <ol>
            <li> Once in our working directory, we can create a new branch (an independent line of develoment) which we can work from by using the "git branch (name of branch)" command.</li>
            <li> We can create files using touch then file name OR code then file name to start editing.</li>
            <li> We can use the "code" command then the name of the file we wish to edit to modify exisiting files.</li>
            <li> After the changes are made, we stage the file using the "git add (file name)".<br/> Or we can use "git add ." to stage all modified files within the directory.</li>
            <li> We can then commit the staged file/s to our LOCAL REPOSITORY using the "git commit -m "messsage" command. The message must be meaningful and relevant.</li>
            <li> Now that the local files have been committed, we have moved them from the staged area to our local repository, ready for pushing to remote repository.</li>
            <li> We can double check all the changes that have been committed by using the command "git log"</li>
        </ol>
