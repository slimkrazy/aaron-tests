SCALA ROCK THE JVM: Lesson 1 (Getting Started)

JVM:
The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) allows computers to run Java programs and other languages that are compiled in Java Bitecode like Scala.
This means that our Scala code will be compiled to the same bytecode that Java runs in.

1. Cloned the rockthejvm github repo to my local repo.

2. Created a new Scala project in the IDE Intellij, using Scala 2.

3. Created a package named playground and then a file within said package named playground.
