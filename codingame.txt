SCALA CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS:

REMEMBER:
- An instruction is something that you tell the computer to do. Examples would be change a var (+=), print to the console (println(x)) 
- An expression is something that has a value and or a type. You're asing the machine to give you the value of something. 
- In functional programming languages like Scala, we think in terms of expressions meaning all our code will compute a value.
- An example of this would be the if expression in Scala:
  val aCondition = true 
  val aConditionedValue = if(aCondition) 5 else 3
  println(aConditionedValue)
- The code above is saying that the aConditionedValue is either 5 if the aCondition is true or 3 if it's false.
- Crucially, the if expression if(aCondition) 5 else 3 actually outputs a value (5 or 3).
- The "ifs" in scala are EXPRESSIONS not INSTRUCTIONS.
Tutorial game: Shoot enemy ships before they reach you.

INSTRUCTIONAL OR EXPRESSION?

if (dist1 < dist2) {
    println(enemy1)
} else {
    println(enemy2)
}
