WHAT IS A FRAMEWORK?

- what is a framework
* A framework, in the context of software development, is a structured set of tools, libraries, 
conventions, and best practices that provides a foundation for building applications. It simplifies 
and streamlines the development process by offering pre-built components and a predefined structure, 
enabling developers to focus more on application-specific logic rather than reinventing common functionalities.


- what is json
*JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to 
read and write, and it is easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is often used to transmit data between a server 
and a web application, as an alternative to XML.
