TASKS:
- Create an endpoint in play framework

behind back end for front end layer, the business logic is held
for offers, there are 2 systems. The webapi-offers and mobileapi-offers, which sends that information to 
offers-internal (an open api) does and checks many things and sends the required info to mobileapi-offers.

What happens when we send a message? 

- User A & User B want to talk
- We represent this by creating a group with an id;123
- We then make the two users members of the group
- Subscriptions mean the users are subscribed to a group. But you can have users
in the group that aren't subscribed meaning they don't see messages.
- This is how chat is represented in chat-internal.

- In chat api we create groups and they refer to two people and perhaps to products.
- In chat api we also have subscription concept.
- We use groups and subcriptions for representation of data.
-Chatapi converts the message request to something that chat internal understands. It will tell
chat internal to send the messages to the users. 
- Whenever you send a message, chat internal stores that data. 
- Chat internal is linked to a database (dynamo db). Postgres and Dynamo are essential
- There is one single user id for users across all systems. 

- Chat internal will fetch the info from the database and then represent that to the users.

- Chatapi already has the capacity to send attachments but the client doesn't allow the 
option to be visible to users.

-Image upload uss the concept known as eventual consistency. (look this up)

DEPOP CODE:

- Routes file: Defines the API endpoints written in Play Framework
- Message controller is a class that uses clients and clients are what the chatapi will make requests to
- Clients are making requests also.
- In the settings folder, you have all the configurations for the applications (messages app) (offer app)
- You must write tests for all the code you work with adding particular inputs to code must result in the output
you expect.
- When it pertains to security you need to run multiple tests. You also run more tests when you're adding something
new as this builds confidence in the code.

- Lookup validators as classes and what makes themm different to other classes. Lookup Dynamo and Postgres. Dynamo is simpler
to understand. 


HACKATHON PRESENTATIONS:

- Get familiar with AWS as many of the presentations used AWS services.

- Great ideas relating to rental, AR, Suscription/Broadcast messages.

- Prompt engineering used for generating relevant responses for cleaning product descriptions.
